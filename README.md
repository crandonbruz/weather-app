# weather-app

## Description
In this application, the weather the user chooses will be displayed on the screen. It shows the current weather, details about the weather, as well as a five day forecast of the upcoming weather. There is also a saved tab where the user has the availability to go back and look at cities they might have already looked up. 
## Instalization
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
